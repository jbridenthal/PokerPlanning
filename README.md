# PokerPlanning
Poker planning tool using .Net Core, C#, Blazor, SingalR and MudBlazor https://mudblazor.com/

This project was just a weekend project mainly to learn singalR and Blazor. While this project does work I have not been happy with the coding of it and have been working on refactoring it so that I can easily add new components for graphs.

Use docker-compose.example.yml to deploy to a server using docker image.
